        <h1>Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome</h1>
        <p>I am Thomas Harvey, a student nurse at SFASU, and I have congenital bilateral spastic diparesis.
I write this in December 2022--in honor of my 21st birthday--to educate you and satiate my fascination with neurology. 
As a baby, right after my birth on the 15th of this month, I had a brain bleed--a grade III IVH (intraventricular hemorrhage), which gave me upper motor neuron syndrome; I will expound upon this soon. 
If you learn nothing else from this, know something: the brain figured itself out!</p>
      </div>
      

      <!--Outline-->
      <div>
        <p>I'll outline what I'm writing here. 
Beginning, I'll contextualize this by providing a comprehensive, detailed review of the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
Then, I'll discuss what an upper motor neuron is, what it does, and where it is found, along with a comparison of upper motor neurons to others. Afterward, I&#39;ll write about a specific type of upper motor neuron, a pyramidal neuron, and motor tracts in the central nervous system. Finally, because you have all the knowledge to understand the concept in its complete depth, I&#39;ll explain upper motor neuron syndrome, along with my pathology. </p>
        <p>Thus, below is a neat review of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology to start you off. </p>

      <!--Neurons-->
      <div>
        <h2 id="neurons">Neurons</h2>
          <p>Neuron, a word coined centuries ago from the Greek word <em>neura</em>, means simply "nerve cell."
Neurons are part of one of the four fundamental tissues in the human body: connective tissue, muscle tissue, and epithelium.
Neurons are electrochemical structures: based on a change in the <em>electrical potential</em>, voltage, across the cell and the interstitium, chemicals, <strong>neurotransmitters</strong>, are released from within to influence another cell. Nerve cells are distinguished in their ability to conduct impulses. 
Neurons were made to transmit neurotransmitters in the direction of other cells or organs. Bundles of neurons (with protective tissue) are collectively titled <strong>nerves</strong>. The longest nerve in your body is the sciatic nerve (which runs from your back down to your tippy-toes) and the shortest one in your body is the trochlear nerve--cranial nerve IV--that controls eye movement. Following the discovery of neurons, it was believed by physiologists of the day that neurons were all connected. This is known as the reticular theory of neurobiology. However, we have known since 1954--with help from the electron microscope--that synapses, little spaces between neurons, exist. These two principles, and a few others, are what is fancifully worded as the <strong>neuron doctrine</strong>. Here is a drawing of a synapse and the last step of neurotransmission, since it takes place there. </p>
          <br>

          <br>
The process of neuron formation begins in utero with the formation of the neural tube, a product of the ectoderm germ layer, which should close during the first trimester of pregnancy. Folic acid is an important co-factor in DNA synthesis--a crucial process during the development of body systems after conception. Without it, incomplete closure of the foundation to the nervous system can occur, causing life-threatening or severely disabling birth defects. Spina bifida and anencephaly are two unfortunate examples of this. 
Neurons are about 5-100 microns in diameter--exceptionally miniscule things. Yet, you (and I) have billions in our brain. The closest estimate we have is about 86 billion, yet it was thought (and even taught) that we had 100 billion. Awesome! Neurons look like trees under microscopes; in fact, the earliest metaphors for describing them included trees--especially their potential to branch out. A germane word you will learn in a moment is related to the Greek root word for tree, <em>dendros</em>. </p>
      </div>

      <!--Neuron Structure-->
      <div>
        <h3 id="neuron-structure">Neuron Structure</h3>
          <p><img src="https://open.oregonstate.education/app/uploads/sites/48/2019/07/1206_The_Neuron_revised.png" alt="Neuron diagram" height="600" width="600"></p>
          <p>Do you notice the neuron's dendrites? Etymologically, it is derived from that special Greek noun. Take notice of its aesthetic and linguistic congruence--a tree is almost a perfect description for what you see. Dendrites are nerve processes that receive impulses. 
The <strong>axon</strong>--the long arm of the neuron--leaves from the nucleated <strong>soma (the cell body)</strong> from the <strong>axon hillock</strong> (unlabeled), a triangular region of the neuron where action potentials are begun. <strong>Myelin</strong>, a cholesterol-rich compound made by Schwann cells (unpictured) in the peripheral nervous system or oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, insulates axons and allows for more efficient travel of action potentials. The exposed gaps in the axon are <strong>myofibril nodes</strong> or <strong>Nodes of Ranvier</strong>, named after the French pathologist and histologist, Louis-Antoine Ranvier, that first found them. The increased speed of conduction happens because the action potentials "jump" from one node to the next. Myelin, electrically speaking, is a form of resistance; it is perfectly reasonable to analogize myelin with rubber over copper wires. The nodes are the places without resistance; hence, <em>saltatory conduction</em> happens in myelinated neurons. Furthermore, because of the process of saltatory conduction, myelinated neurons conduct faster than unmyelinated neurons. </p>
      </div>

      <!--Action Potentials-->
      <div>
        <h3 id="action-potentials">Action Potentials</h3>
          <p>That makes for a quite nice segue into action potentials, which are electrochemical cascades that allow neurons to produce eventful consequences. Neurons, like all cells, have a normal distribution of positive or negative electrical charge across both the inside and outside of the cell. Without any extrinsic or intrinsic factors, neurons have a difference of charge of -70 mV, a <strong>resting membrane potential (RMP)</strong>. Primarily, RMP maintanence involves ion channels--membrane-bound proteins that limit or open for the flow of charged (+/-) particles in the cell. Ion channels can be either activated by a substance, <strong>ligand-gated</strong>, or activated by electric potential, <strong>voltage-gated.</strong> Normally, sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions are found in greater amounts outside of the neuron; potassium (K+) ions and proteins are found in greater concentrations inside the neuron. Specifically, the sodium-potassium pump--a ligand-gated pump--transmits three sodium ions and two potassium ions in opposite directions for every ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the cell&#39;s energy currency) to spend; the sodium moves outside of the cell, and the potassium moves into the cell. Na+/K+ ATPase (the sodium-potassium pump) causes no significant deviation in the voltage by itself because, usually, every other type of membrane pump is closed during rest. Here is a visual to help. </p>
          <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HalfFelineHornshark-size_restricted.gif" alt="Na-K ATPase" height="600" width="600">
        <h4 id="how-does-an-action-potential-happen-">How Does an Action Potential Happen?</h4>
          <p>The action of ion channels (like the enzyme just mentioned) causes a smaller negative--or more positive--electric potential. If a stimulus is provided to a nerve cell, then this can potential difference can change further. If this does not happen, then an action potential does not transmit--action potentials obey the <strong>all-or-nothing law.</strong> The voltage required to start an action potential is the <strong>threshold potential (-55 mV).</strong> The increase in voltage is termed <strong>depolarization.</strong> If the stimulus is strong enough and the threshold potential is crossed, then a continual action potential can be initiated. The steps required for an action potential are thus: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>A stimulus is provided to the neuron through neurotransmitters or sensation.</li>
            <li>Sodium diffuses into the cell. </li>
            <li>The neuron depolarizes by opening up voltage-gated sodium channels once the threshold is met.</li>
            <li>As the potential depolarizes to about 40 mV, Na+ channels close and K+ channels open, pouring K+ out of the cell.</li>
            <li><strong>Hyperpolarization</strong>, the state of a neuron below resting membrane potential, is in effect. </li>
            <li>A <em>refractory period</em>, where no further stimulation can take place, overtakes the neuron.</li>
            <li>Calcium (Ca 2+) ions enter the cell through voltage-gated calcium channels, and bind to terminal buds of neurons, where vesicles (sacs) of neurotransmitters can be released to the next neuron.</li>
            <li><strong>Repolarization</strong>, the process of returning to the resting membrane potential, begins by sodium and potassium ion channels becoming reset and the Na+/K+ ATPase transmembrane protein acting as expected. </li>
          </ol>
          <p>This process is repeated in the next neuron (and so on and so forth) until the effector is reached, wherein the neurotransmitter will cause another predictable effect. Neurons aren&#39;t the only cells that undergo action potentials; skeletal muscles and cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) do as well. </p>
      </div>

      <!--Graded Potentials-->
      <div>
        <h4 id="graded-potentials">Graded Potentials</h4>
        <p>I'll be brief about these, yet these are of exceptionally important to my disease. A <strong>graded potential</strong> is a difference in membrane potential that can vary in degree. There are two types of graded potential to know now: <em>inhibitory</em> post-synaptic potential and <em>excitatory</em> post-synaptic potential. Inhibitory post-synaptic potentials cause the neuron to become hyperpolarized through ionic influx (flowing inside of the cell). Excitatory post-synaptic potentials can lead to the neuron firing off an action potential. Gamma-aminobutyric acid is a neurotransmitter that controls inhibitory graded potentials, letting chloride or potassium flow into the cell as a result, making it less likely that a neuron will fire. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that causes EPSPs (excitatory post-synaptic potentials). Graded potentials differ from action potentials in that they&#39;re local and can be summated (added or lessened as a stimulus is weakened or strengthened).</p>

      <!--Morphological Classification of Neurons-->
      <div>
        <h3 id="morphological-classification-of-neurons">Morphological Classification of Neurons</h3>
          <p>Neurons can be classified by the number of processes (dendrites that come from the soma) they have; each neuron only has one axon. Pyramidal neurons are a type of multipolar neuron that you can read about later. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unipolar -- a neuron consisting of only a single neurite<ul>
            <li>Humans have pseudounipolar neurons, where the cell body has one extension acting as both an axon and dendrite  </li>
          </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bipolar -- having a dendrite and an axon (found in the CN IIX and retinae)<ul>
            <li>Bipolar neurons are specialized for sensory reception.</li>
          </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Multipolar -- having three or more processes<ul>
            <li>These are found in the central nervous system and are the most common type of neuron morphologically.

        <h2 id="the-central-nervous-system">The Central Nervous System</h2>
          <h3 id="brain">Brain</h3>
            <p>The brain functions to make us who we are. The brain only weighs about 2-4 pounds and is 75% water. On the inside, it is composed of white matter, whereas it is grey matter on the inside. White matter is white due to the myelin that coats nerves, a fatty barrier that helps with saltatory conduction. Since the brain holds power over our vital signs (respirations, pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and pain sensation), we could not live without a brain. The brainstem, cerebrum, and cerebellum compose the structure of the brain. The brainstem regulates our vital signs and connects the brain to the spinal cord; the cerebrum furnishes us to be expressive, logical, aware, talkative, and mobile beings; and the cerebellum (Latin for "little brain") coordinates our motor functions, engages our proprioception (an advanced term for the body knowing where it is), and maintains our balance--also known as equilibrium. Because it is most relevant, I&#39;ll be discussing the cerebrum. As an aside, what makes a person a person and not an animal can be answered by looking towards what our cerebra do for us. The reason you can read and learn from this right now is because you have a cerebrum!</p>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Here's an image so you don't have to use your imagination--colored for your convenience.</p>
            <img src="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/images/health/1_-conditions/brain/brain-main-parts.ashx" alt="Brain anatomy" height="600" width="600">
            <h4>Cerebral Divisions</h4>
            <p>The cerebrum is very "wrinkly". A fold in the cerebrum due to these "wrinkles" is known as a gyrus (pl. gyri), and a fold itself is known as a sulcus (pl. sulci). These help increase the brain's surface area. Imagine if you folded a sheet and put it in your head. Wouldn't you be able to fit more cloth in your head if you folded it? The cloth is like the gyri but the seams/creases are like the sulci.</p>
            <p>The cerebrum is partitioned into two halves by the <b>longitudinal or (interhemispheric) fissure </b>(pictured below).</p>
            <img src="https://image.slideserve.com/762904/longitudinal-fissure-l.jpg" height="600" width="600">
            <p>The amount of gyri and sulci is honestly overwhelming, but--because it is proximate to areas I will write of later--you should know of the <b>Rolandic fissure,</b> named after Italian anatomist Luigi Rolando. It is also referred to as the central sulcus most commonly. Alternatively, it may be known as the Rolando fissure or fissure of Rolando. The Rolandic fissure is pictured below.</p>
            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Q08ae3yaQ8A1_fOUxcLZiQHaFU?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" height="600" width="600" alt="Rolando fissure">
            <p>The areas that it separates are the <em>somatomotor cortex</em> and <em>sensory cortex</em>. The somatomotor cortex is in front of the sulcus and is known as the <b>precentral gyrus</b>, whereas the sensory cortex is behind the sulcus and is known as the <b>postcentral gyrus</b>. </p>
            <h4 id="brain-lobes">Brain Lobes</h4>
              <p>A discussion on the lobes of the brain will profit us for now--having knowledge of the frontal and parietal lobes is crucial for later--we'll come back to them. </p>
              <p><img src="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_extra_large/public/2022-04/KYB_Brain_Basics_BrainLabeled_400px.png?itok=f7Pmhszv" alt="Brain lobes" height="600" width="600"></p>
              <h6 id="frontal-lobe">Frontal Lobe</h6>
                <p>The frontal lobe is the area of the brain responsible for impulse control, personality, cognition, and emotion. In psychology, these functions are known as "executive." Damage to the frontal lobe results in changes to the personality. Phineas Gage's life demonstrates this fact. This area of the brain is affected in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which matures much later in individuals with ADHD. The frontal lobe is done maturing around age 25. The posterior region of the frontal lobe comprises the <strong>motor cortex.</strong> The motor cortex is the area of the brain that controls voluntary muscle movement. The motor cortex can be mapped out onto the body via the <strong>homunculus</strong>, created by Wilder Penfield, a Canadian-American neurosurgeon. By knowing the homunculus, you can topographically isolate a lesion on the basis of what muscles/limbs are affected. This same line of thought may be applied to the somatosensory cortex. 
                <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9165c4_85b92fddb0a444d1ad8d5dbde7995530~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_900,h_682,al_c,q_90/9165c4_85b92fddb0a444d1ad8d5dbde7995530~mv2.jpg" alt="Homunculus" height="600" width="600"></p>
              <h6 id="parietal-lobe">Parietal Lobe</h6>
                <p>The parietal lobe is the lobe that equips us with sensation and integrates this information. Touch, temperature, and pain sensation all originate in this lobe. However, the brain does not in itself have pain receptors. In addition, this lobe allows us to know objects from sensation, known as stereognosis. Anterior to the parietal lobe (and within it) is the <strong>somatosensory cortex</strong>, the area of the brain that controls sensation. </p>
              <h6 id="temporal-lobe">Temporal Lobe</h6>
                <p>The temporal lobe is a lobe of the brain associated with hearing, language acquisition, and memory. It is the second-largest lobe of the brain (22% of the cerebrum). Damage in this area of the brain can lead to <em>sensorineural</em> hearing loss (cortical deafness), a type of hearing loss from neurological deficit, or even prosopagnosia, the loss of facial recognition. </p>
              <h6 id="occipital-lobe">Occipital Lobe</h6>
                <p>The smallest lobe of the brain is responsible for visual processing: color, depth perception, and object recognition. A phenomenon known as visual agnosia can result with damage to this lobe where you can see an object but not name it properly. Additionally, cortical blindness may result from this same cause. </p>
          <h3 id="the-spinal-cord">The Spinal Cord</h3>
            <p>The spinal cord is responsible for connecting the body and the brain and transmitting impulses between the two. Spanning from the <em>foramen magnum</em>--the large bore in the base of the cranium--to the <em>cauda equina</em>, literally Latin for "horse's tail," it's also responsible for reflexes. Notice that the grey matter--unmyelinated axons along with neuroglia, capillaries, and neurons' somata--makes up the <em>deep</em> portion, but the white matter--consisting mainly of myelinated axons--is the <em>superficial</em> substance. </p>

                <p>The spinal cord as you can notice is divided into sections: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. We have a total of 24 vertebrae, bones in the spine (numbered from the top down), but 31 pairs of spinal nerves. Note that the five sacral and 4 coccygeal vertebrae fuse to form vertebrae as we grow; originally, at birth, we have 33 vertebrae. Each type of vertebra has different processes on the vertebral body, yet all have vertebral (fibrocartilaginous) discs for shock absorption. Between each vertebra, you have these: </p>
                <img src="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/contentassets/71d2bd70f4234d73ace154cdb77fca3b/a00534f02_vertebrae-crosssection-compressor.jpg" alt="Intervertebral discs" height="600" width="600"></p>
                <p>From each of these levels of the spine, spinal nerves erupt providing both sensation and motor output to the body at certain areas called a <strong>dermatome,</strong> corresponding to a vertebra and nerve pair (e.g., T10--the tenth thoracic vertebra and/or nerve). Epidurals, a type of spinal analgesia given during labor and delivery, block sensation up to the 10th thoracic vertebra/dermatome--my favorite professor taught me that it goes up to the belly button! Below is a figure of your dermatome levels. </p>

                <p>A spinal cord injury (SCI) can result when the spinal cord is hurt. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, denervation can occur below the level of impact. SCI can be classified as either complete or incomplete. Clinically, transection above C3 is fatal because the diaphragm's nerve, the phrenic nerve, is cut. This leads to respiratory paralysis and anoxic brain injury. </p>
          <h3>Ventricular System</h3>
            <p>The ventricular system is the main cavity within the central nervous system. Ependymal cells line this system. Cerebrospinal fluid--produced by these cells and in this cavity--acts to absorb mechanical force in the event of a shock or blow to the head or back. It is like our blood in lots of ways except that it involves the use of no pump/muscle or shared circulation with the rest of the body. The ventricular system is separated from our general circulation vis-a-vis the blood-brain barrier--which is furnished by astrocytes. The image of a neurovascular unit--the part that joins the cardiovascular system and the neurological system--below should give you a perspective on how this works; anatomically and physiologically, neurons and astrocytes, along with pericytes, connect the brain to a blood supply, yet maintain semi-permeability to guard brain tissue.</p>

              <p>Below is a picture of the places where cerebrospinal fluid is circulated, <b>ventricles</b>. The largest ventricles here are the lateral ventricles--there are two of them. Blockage of this system can lead to hydrocephalus, a neurological condition affecting babies and adults alike where hydrostatic pressure hurts the brain due to an accumulation of CSF in the wrong place. Symptoms (in babies) include high-pitched cry, vomiting, poor feeding (weak suck), fussiness, bulging fontanels (soft spots of the head), hypotonia, restlessness, increase in the head circumference, weakness, and seizures. Adults can have falls, memory difficulty, confusion, ataxia, incontinence, and dementia. Urinary incontinence, dementia, and gait instability are altogether known as the Hakim triad--most commonly associated with NPH, normal pressure hydrocephalus.</p>

      <!--Peripheral Nervous System-->
      <div>
        <h2 id="peripheral-nervous-system">Peripheral Nervous System</h2>
          <p>The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is any nerve found outside of the brain and spinal cord. By this definition, some even consider cranial nerves (nerves found within the skull) to be a part of the PNS. In each nerve, neurons are arranged in a parallel fashion and covered by a connective tissue band--<strong>epineurium</strong>. Neurons grouped together are bunched as fascicles. A sheath around each fascicle, the <strong>perineurium</strong>, protects them. Outside of each fascicle are other fascicles and vasculature--arteries and veins. Every fascicle and vessel is packed in by <strong>epineurium</strong>, the outermost connective tissue layer inside the nerve. </p>

          <p>There are many divisions of the peripheral nervous system, which I&#39;ll touch on. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sensory--the division of the nervous system that holds all afferent neurons</li>
              <li>Motor--the division of the nervous system that holds all efferent neurons</li>
              <li>Somatic--the division of the nervous system that controls organs voluntarily</li>
              <li>Autonomic--the division of the nervous system that controls organs involuntarily</li>
            </ul>
          <h4 id="autonomic-nervous-system">Autonomic Nervous System</h4>
            <p>The autonomic (from the Greek <em>auto-</em> &amp; <em>nomos</em>, literally "self-law") division is also made of the parasympathetic--the "feed and breed" system--and sympathetic nervous system--the "fight-or-flight" system. The parasympathetic system, which uses acetylcholine, calms the body: the heart rate slows, the respiratory tract constricts, sweat abounds, gastrointestinal motility is excited, and the bladder's retention is relieved. The opposite happens with the sympathetic nervous system, which action is mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine--catecholamines that act on alpha and beta receptors. The sympathetic nervous system generates an acceleration in the heart rate, promotion of bronchodilation, and lessening of perspiration. Each organ has <strong>dual autonomic innervation</strong>--both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation--to precisely control the rate of function. In case I missed anything, I leave this here for you! </p>

      <!--What is an Upper Motor Neuron?-->
      <div>
        <h2 id="what-is-an-Upper-Motor-Neuron-">What is an Upper Motor Neuron?</h2>
          <p>An <strong>upper motor neuron (UMN)</strong> is any neuron of the brain and/or spinal cord that influences a neuron which innervates an effector organ (i.e., a muscle, gland, or tissue). These are in contrast to neurons that activate effectors--known as <strong>lower motor neurons</strong>. Dysfunction of UMNs produces specific signs--components of upper motor neuron syndrome. Both upper and lower motor neurons (proverbially) stand in opposition to sensory neurons, which are nerve cells that transmit signals from the body to the brain or spinal cord. Motor neurons may also be called <strong>efferent neurons</strong> and sensory neurons might also be termed <strong>afferent neurons</strong>. Here's one table about motor versus sensory neurons and another about upper motor neurons versus lower motor neurons. Sensory neurons or lower motor neurons won't be discussed further--that'll be for another time and place.</p>

          <p>Upper motor neurons run from the primary motor cortex (in the frontal lobe of the brain) to the brainstem or the cauda equina of the spinal cord. These are usually pyramidal cells, which are named because of their micrographs. These neurons comprise the white matter of the spinal cord and grey matter of the brain. There are two upper motor tracts of the central nervous syndrome (CNS) that are of particular import now: the <strong>corticospinal tract</strong> and the <strong>corticobulbar tract</strong>. Together, they're known as the <strong>pyramidal tract</strong>--after the neurons' morphology.</p>
      </div>

      <!--Pyramidal Neurons-->
      <div>
        <h4 id="pyramidal-neurons">Pyramidal Neurons</h4>
          <p>Neurons, if you recall, are amitotic cells, meaning they do not divide from a single mother cell into two daughter cells. This is why neurological conditions are not curable--once the damage is done, you cannot recover the cells that functioned before. Like ova (if you are a female reading this), you are born with all the neurons you will ever have. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease, provides a prominent illustration of this phenomenon.</p>
          <p>Pyramidal neurons are special neurons that look like pyramids on the apical and basal ends--both the axons and dendrites. They were discovered by Santiago Carmon y Rajal, the father of modern neuroscience. He looked at them under a microscope with the help of a Golgi stain (also known as <em>la reazione nera</em>--the black reaction). See for yourself! I love these pictures because of the complexity and beauty, but am slightly saddened because I lost some in my first days. At any rate, I have put two diagrams of pyramidal neurons so that you can see their shape. What you should know about them is that they secrete either gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glutamate. This, in turn, makes them either inhibitory or excitatory, </p>

      <!--What is Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome?-->
      <div>
        <h3 id="what-is-upper-motor-neuron-syndrome-">What is Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome?</h3>
          <p>Upper motor neuron syndrome is a term comprising five manifestations: (1) spasticity, (2) hyperreflexia/abnormal reflexes, (3) weakness, (4) clonus, and (5) difficulty with fine motor movements. This affects motor neurons that are--by definition--in the CNS. I have this, and am proud that I can educate you about it. </p>
        <h4 id="corticospinal-tract">Corticospinal tract</h4>
          <p>This is a motor tract in the CNS that controls voluntary muscles in the body&#39;s trunk and limbs--beginning in the cerebral cortex. It is myelinated during the first two years of life. This is the reason why a newborn can have a Babinski sign until the age of 2 without causing concern--more on this later. This is a descending pathway of the central nervous system. The cell bodies are in the cortex, while the axons descend down the anterior or lateral white column (fundiculus) of the spinal cord. Look at the red parts of the diagram I provide to figure out where my point of reference is. Damage to the brain or spinal cord of this area causes UMN disease. Severe damage to the lateral corticospinal tract can cause decorticate posturing (shown below). </p>

        <h4 id="corticobulbar-tract">Corticobulbar tract</h4>
          <p>This is another motor tract in the CNS that controls the facial and cervical muscles. Specifically it innervates every cranial nerve except VII and XII. The pathology is specific to the cranial nerve that is affected. Because of their anatomy, lesions to this tract may present abnormalities <em>ipsilaterally</em>--on the same side.</p>
        <h4 id="manifestations">Manifestations</h4>
          <p>Below are descriptions of the parts of UMN syndrome/disease. These are caused by lesions of the pyramidal tract. I also include small epilogues to consider these aspects and how they affect me. </p>
            <h5 id="spasticity">Spasticity</h5>
              <p>Spasticity was first defined by Dr. James Waldo Lance, an Australian neurologist, as a velocity-dependent increase in the tonic stretch reflex in 1980. This is in contrast to rigidity, velocity-independent increases in the tonic stretch reflex. Spastic muscles are muscles that provide resistance when stretching--if you were to try and stretch my legs, then you'd feel a pull against your hand. The faster you push, the more resistance you feel. There may even be a <em>clasp-knife</em> phenomenon, where after pushing against the muscle, it suddenly becomes easy to move--like a knife closing in on itself. Spasticity is managed with physiotherapy, Baclofen, orthoses, and surgery. Spasticity, if severe, can totally immobilize joints and lead to contractures. I have had contractures before, but never total immobilization. Spasticity can come about due to cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and cerebral infarction (stroke). Interestingly, spasticity can protect against deep venous thrombi and atrophy. </p>
              <h6 id="my-feelings-with-spasticity">My Feelings with Spasticity</h6>
              <p>Spasticity, since my infancy, has affected my legs and hips. Growing up, I walked funny because my muscles were weakened--all down my lower limbs. This wasn't a scissor gait, but a crouch gait--where it looked like I was always crouching when I took steps. I was born with right equinovarus deformity of my right ankle--I walked on my tip-toes for most of my life. My triceps surae was tight, so my foot was constantly contracted downward. As I grew, I continued to be spastic. This was relieved with a major surgery near my 16th birthday. However, through my time as a nursing student at 20 years old, I grew taller, and my spasticity returned so that I walked with a scissor gait. I was also diagnosed with clonus and my neurologist said I had "moderate spasticity throughout my lower extremities." I underwent physiotherapy (with an intelligent physical therapist) and bought some ankle-foot orthoses (a special type of brace that goes around my ankles and feet) to help. About a month ago, my legs continually spasmed as I awoke and slept--with my parents telling me "You're getting taller!" I have yet to see if I am six feet tall. Spasticity from my diagnosis is non-progressive; however, spasticity is not always non-progressive. Spasticity, throughout my childhood, hit me hardest near growth spurts and always affected me. Physically, I am a late bloomer, so I believe that I might still be growing because my legs don't usually spasm. Finally, a week ago, I was told by my podiatrist (who I saw for another issue unrelated to my palsied legs) after I asked "Hallux valgus--do you know what that is? Do I have it?" that I had bent toes due to spasticity in my triceps surae.</p>
            <h5 id="hyperreflexia-umn-reflexes">Hyperreflexia/UMN reflexes</h5>
              <p>Have you ever tested your reflexes? I have. I tested my brachioradialis reflex so much one time that I bruised my arm and made it yellow. I'll write out each reflex and where it is modulated along the spinal cord so that you may know where they are. </p>
                <p>Brachioradialis--C5-C7</p>
                <p>Patellar--L2-L4</p>
                <p>Plantar--S4-S5, L1-L2</p>
                <p>Achilles--S1-S2</p>
                <p>Biceps--C5-C6</p>
                <p>Triceps--C7-C8</p>
              <h6 id="my-reflexes-plus-abnormals">My Reflexes Plus Abnormals</h6>
                <p>I have hyperreflexia, meaning my reflexes are increased and forceful. This is abnormal. Every one of my reflexes is hyperreflexive, and my ankle is clonic. I include more details about this when I write about it there. </p>
                <p>In addition to hyperreflexia, I have an abnormal reflex: the Hoffman's sign, from the name of Johann Hoffman. My new rehabilitation doctor, when I met her, tested my arms and then did this sign. It is where you take the patient's upper extremity, relax it, grab the middle finger by the distal interphalangeal joint, and strike the fingernail. A positive Hoffman sign is abnormal and is when the thumb and index finger flex. I have this on both sides. Conversely, a negative Hoffman's sign is no response--normally. The Hoffman sign is common in cervical myelopathy, spinal cord damage near the C-spine. It is also important to note, the Babinski sign--which I wrote about earlier--is abnormal after two years of age. The Babinski response, uncovered by French neurologist Joseph Babinski in 1896, happens when--testing the plantar reflex by stroking the lateral side of the foot and moving to the ball of the foot--the hallux (great toe) dorsiflexes and the other toes abduct, push apart from one another, and plantarflex, flex toward the ground. The normal plantar reflex is plantarflexion of all toes. I do not have a normal or abnormal reflex, strangely. This is called an equivocal Babinski sign. There are other <strong>Babinski-like signs</strong> that I will write here; the normal values for these are no response and to the best of my knowledge, I have none of these.</p>

                  <p>5 -- the muscle can forcefully contract and mobilize the joint through full range of motion and gravity</p>

                <h6 id="how-weak-am-i-">How Weak Am I?</h6>
                <p>I've never been able to lift heavy things from the floor, yet even heavy things I lift always get put down onto my legs and I walk them over to the destination. These body mechanics are horrible, but sometimes I don't have help and do what I can. All my life, if you sat me down on the floor and told me to get up without using my hands, I couldn't--I would just sit content on my legs. Nor can I sit down on my knees--my ankles don't move far enough. My muscle strength was always tested by my doctor at Houston's Shriner's Hospital for Children (where I went to treat cerebral palsy), Dr. Allison Cooper Scott. I loved her so much--I miss her today. She always told me and my parents that I should stretch every day (I was usually commited to this.) to strengthen my muscles. I did this, and am proud to say, after my operation from her in 2017, I achieved full range of motion with both legs and 5/5 muscle (motor) strength. This changed last year--as of now, because of my spasticity, I have 5/5 strength of my left leg and 4/5 of my right. I have to stretch every day and see how this will pan out for my future. Maybe one day, I'll be able to move my body with more ease.</p>
              <h5 id="fine-motor-difficulty">Fine motor difficulty</h5>
                <p>Fine motor skills refer to control of small muscle groups to accomplish a task. Examples of fine motor skills include painting, writing your name, or performing surgery, etc. Neurological development is tracked as we grow up in reference to these tasks. However, insult to the nervous system--upper motor neurons--can cause tremors. Damage to the basal ganglia of the extrapyramidal system can cause tremors as well, as is common in Parkinson's, ataxic cerebral palsy, and infection, etc.
I have developed tremors in each hand, making it difficult to hold and manage tiny utensils such as an inoculating loop, syringe, or paperclip. Patients can develop such experiences as a result of UMN disease. Complaints will center around such trouble.  </p>
              <h5 id="clonus">Clonus</h5>
                <p>Clonus is a sign of upper motor neuron disease. It can be seen in multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy (which I have), cerebral infarction, TBI, or serotonin syndrome. Clonus is an upper motor neuron sign of any particular reflex that is rhythmic and oscillating. It is most common in the ankles, yet it might happen in the wrists, jaw, or even biceps. My favorite teacher taught and related to me that it is a sign of pre-eclampsia, meaning that "pregnant mamas are about to have seizures." (In one theory of pre-eclampsia, neuron damage is precipitated by ischemia of the brain.)  Any reflex you can think of might be clonic. As a clinician, you want to count how many times you see the reflex repeat. My ankles shook for many more than 10 beats, making it <em>sustained</em> ankle clonus; I taught her that. Ankle clonus is diagnosed through a neurologist's examination (since nurses do not have the authority to diagnose), whereby (in the course of a neurological assessment), he/she relaxes and then dorsiflexes the ankle, holding it in resistance to find out if it recoils back-and-forth in his/her hand. It is considered positive if the Achilles reflex continues for more than 1-2 beats, and a further work-up may be indicated. Other forms of clonus may be diagnosed in a similar manner. Clonus is abnormal, and according to some practitioners, an outcome of spasticity.</p>
                <h6 id="my-adventure-with-clonus">My Adventure with Clonus</h6>
                  <p>I was diagnosed with clonus almost one year ago on the fourteenth of January 2022. I wrote on my doctor's form that my CC--chief complaint--was "hyperkinesia of my ankles." I told my neurologist before he ever touched me, "I'll tell you the medical term of what I think this is: ankle clonus." My HPI (history of present illness), I strongly emphasized, is that my legs <em>constantly</em> shook when I sat down. Months before I went to the doctor, I had drank an entire gallon of milk by myself in one day, convinced that I had a calcium deficiency. My legs still tremored. Additionally, convicted to the idea that I was just exceptionally anxious, I stayed alone in my room for 2 hours staring at my legs and listening to my favorite song over and over. My legs still tremored. I watched my legs shake for 30 minutes that night, which was on my birthday last year, stopping only because I believed I had enough evidence to call that clonus.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>I say all this so that you may know that clonus is not caused by nutritional deficiency or anxiety. Additionally, clonus is not voluntary.</em></strong>  </p>
                <h6 id="ankle-clonus-test">Ankle Clonus Test</h6>
                  <p> He told me to hop up on the examiner's table after he tested all my reflexes and asked me of my health history. I closed my eyes and relaxed, following his directions. I felt relieved as I sensed him take my ankle and press it toward my leg, kicking back in response. Right then, I had my hypothesis and the diagnosis confirmed. It&#39;s a simple test, truly. I wasn't sent in for an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), EEG (electroencephalogram), or an EMG (electromyogram) due to my pre-existing condition--it's not an emergency nor was it unexpected. I have discovered--through playing with my own feet like a child--that to elicit clonus, I must relax my ankle. I have motor control over my ankle and can make myself resistant to movement when thinking about moving my foot. If you ever need to test clonus, for good measure, always play with the patient's feet, moving them around-and-around to ensure accuracy, then briskly dorsiflex the foot and hold the foot against your hand. This motion is the ankle clonus test. It means that there is issue at the first and second sacral vertebra, where that particular reflex is modulated. </p>
                <h6 id="results-and-interpretation">Results and Interpretation</h6>
                  <p>  On the reflex scale of 0-4, clonus is a 4, yet one might see it written as a 5 meaning it is sustained and 4 is not. All deep tendon reflexes--brachioradialis, patellar, biceps, triceps, and Achilles--are graded on the scale of 0-4. </p>
                  <p> <strong><em>Reflex Grades</em></strong> </p>
                    <p>  0 -- <strong>areflexia</strong>: there is not any reflex activity </p>
                    <p>  1 -- <strong>hyporeflexia</strong>: there is diminished reflex activity </p>
                    <p>  2 -- <strong>normoreflexia</strong>: there is normal reflex activity </p>
                    <p>  3 -- <strong>hyperreflexia</strong>: there is increased, brisk reflex activity </p>
                    <p>  4 -- <strong>hyperreflexia with clonus</strong>: in addition, there is a clonic aftereffect</p>
                  <p>  Remember to test reflexes bilaterally!</p>
                  <p>  Clonus might be unilateral or bilateral. In my case, because of my brain bleed I had as a baby, both sides of my brain are affected, so my clonus is bilateral. Months ago, when I was in physiotherapy for my spasticity, I met a man who had ankle clonus of his left ankle. I didn&#39;t ask what he had but I knew from his age and unilateral tremor that it was a stroke that he went through. Eventually, he told me that he had a stroke from eating Ray&#39;s hamburgers all the time, which is a local restaurant in my town. He had a right-sided stroke--the pyramidal tracts of the brain (in neurons controlling the limbs) <em>deccusate</em> to the opposite side.   </p>
                <h6 id="treatment">Treatment</h6>
                  <p> <strong>Finally, clonus is not curable, since it is caused by a <em>permanent motor lesion</em>.</strong> </p>
                  <p> Clonus is treatable with Botox or Baclofen. Baclofen is a GABA-B agonist which decreases spasticity by binding to these receptors in neurons. It is available in oral (5-20 milligrams) or intrathecal (pumped) formulations. Unfortunately, this did not work for me. This medicine made me super drowsy--a common side effect--and didn't even stop my clonus. The only other option for me is Botox, onobotuliumtoxina, an injected, anti-spasticity medicine approved in 1991 by the FDA. Botox would--for my benefit--be injected in my gastrocnemius muscle--since this is the muscle that is contracting during my clonic fits. Chemodenervation occurs with it because transmission of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter of the peripheral nervous system, is blocked. Botox wears off in time--about 6-9 months--because the affected nerve sprouts a new axon to reinnervate the area. </p>

      <!--My Pathology-->
      <div>
        <h3 id="my-pathology">My Pathology</h3>
          <p> I was born on December 15, 2001, in Houston, Texas (Ben Taub General Hospital) at 27 weeks and 1 pound and 13.5 ounces suffering from a grade III intraventricular hemorrhage. The ventricle is a section of the brain that holds cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a special fluid in the brain that protects and nourishes the central nervous system. CSF is made by ependymal cells, a type of neuroglia. Intraventricular hemorrhaging happens commonly in premature infants--bleeding in the ventricles. Grade III means that there is so much bleeding that it is enlarging the ventricles--this pressure, along with free radicals/oxygen species (atoms that take electrons from the environment due to chemical instability, wreaking havoc on various body systems), damages the white matter of the brain. Because of where this happened (the lateral ventricles or third ventricle), I probably had <strong>periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)</strong>, damage to my white matter around the ventricles. Here is a picture of the brain of infant born at 26 weeks after experiencing this. This is a coronal section--meaning that it was cut to show from the front. </p>

          <p>Here is a radiograph of a brain with this same condition. This is a transverse computerized tomography scan of an infant brain with a grade III IVH with PVL.</p>

          <p>Where my white matter was damaged is important. I had damage to my motor cortex, along the top section (corresponding to the region by the hips and legs and feet) in each hemisphere. To be more precise, around my precentral gyrus is where this happened. I know this because I have a diagnosis and signs of <strong>pyramidal diplegic cerebral palsy</strong>. Cerebral palsy is a motor disorder and the most common childhood physical disability. My postcentral gyrus or somatosensory cortex was not affected in any way--I can feel every square inch of my body, just like most everyone else. If the grey matter of the brain becomes damaged, one can have intellectual disability--I do not. I was diagnosed as a toddler, for sure, but potentially even earlier (per my parents). UMN signs are what I have due to it. How this works is, specifically, pyramidal neurons in my cortex that secreted GABA were killed. (This is why children with spastic cerebral palsy have Baclofen when other treatments do not work.) Therefore, action potentials are more likely to fire, and those other neurons increase my muscle tone and reflexes. Thus, there is less inhibitory signaling to my corticospinal tract, causing my hyperreflexia, spasticity, weakness, clonus, and Hoffman's sign. </p>

      <div>
<h5 id="Benediction">Thank you and God bless! This is one of my battles in life, and I am thankful to God for making me this way. I think everyone should know about the nervous system and cerebral palsy because everyone should--regardless of the extent of their limitation--be treated equally. I am blessed every day for how God helped me 21 years ago and continues to assist me in life. I wish you all the best. Christ Jesus loves you and died for your sins!</h5>
